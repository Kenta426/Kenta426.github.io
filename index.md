I am a third-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Statistics and Data Science](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/statistics-datascience/index.html) 
at Carnegie Mellon University, where I am fortunate to be advised by [
Arun Kumar Kuchibhotla.
](https://arun-kuchibhotla.github.io/)

My previous research projects roughly revolve 
around several key themes:

1. Non-asymptotic extensions of local asymptotic minimax theorem 
2. Optimal estimation of non-smooth statistical functionals under structural assumptions
3. Projection estimators on tangent cones and the failures of "standard" bootstrap 
4. Irregular \{non/semi-parametric, shape-restricted, dimension-agnostic\} inference

My mind, often scattered, traverses art, philosophy, and political science.
I am currently reading _Gravity and Grace_ by Simone Weil and _The Disappearance of Rituals_ by Byung-Chul Han.
