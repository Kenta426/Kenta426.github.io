I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Statistics and Data Science](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/statistics-datascience/index.html) 
at Carnegie Mellon University, where I am fortunate to be advised by [
Arun Kumar Kuchibhotla.
](https://arun-kuchibhotla.github.io/)

My research often uses techniques from empirical process theory and nonparametrics to analyze problems related to the following topics:
1. Minimax and efficiency theory for non-smooth/irregular problems
2. Projection estimators on tangent cones and their behavior on the boundary
3. Model selection under dependent and heavy-tailed data
4. \{Non/semi-parametric, shape-restricted, dimension-agnostic\} inference
5. Geometry of statistical irregularity
